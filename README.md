Maybe something to do with Gallows?

Some new lastborn kinship is created. who should it be?
- What about the Varginha Devil of Brazil? It is also a South American myth, so there's some connection with the Silbon (kind of).

- The three ridged head and red eyes might be a good direction to go.

An Adalonean hangman discovers these new lastborn. Perhaps they initially clash, but soon grow respect for one another. (This will depend a great deal on what the whistlers might have made them for.)
