### Story Brainstorm

Maybe something to do with Gallows?

Some new lastborn kinship is created. who should it be?
- What about the Varginha Devil of Brazil? It is also a South American myth, so there's some connection with the Silbon (kind of).
- https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Varginha_Devil
- The three ridged head and red eyes might be a good direction to go.

An Adalonean hangman discovers these new lastborn. Perhaps they initially clash, but soon grow respect for one another. (This will depend a great deal on what the whistlers might have made them for.)

So maybe give them unique units so that the two groups can battle one another for multiple missions.

Maybe a reason to try to move west?

Maybe creating a home in Croatova?

That would mean making fortifications, rather than conquering, which is fun too.



Lastborn Kinship:Thunn’ha?

Name:

-Thunn’ha (Lovecraftian Frog People) thuum'ha
-Loveland Frog?
-https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Thuum%27ha?file=Thuumha.jpg


Abilities:

- Magic wands
- Maybe the ability to channel electricity through wood? Thus,the wands and sprays of sparks.
- Maybe they speak or see through wood?
- Maybe their mouths are enormous and only for eating, but the sparks make sounds like talking.
- Maybe their hands and feet come from snail shells and they have eyestalks in their hands that look like wands.
- I think their tongues should also be a semi-autonomous part of their anatomy, perhaps with eyes of its own.
- The frog appearance could BE the shell.

Purpose:

- To befriend the hangmen? Like this is the plan somehow?
- To carry disease.
- Something to do with the towns/forts they defend.
- These guys have mortal souls, and mortal souls bring life and change from the Manifest for the Host Kings and carry back dust and certainty from Destron for the Whistlers.
- Maybe they carry something else? Memory and experience? Naivete and wonder? Some unique aspect of life?
- Why create a new mortal soul for lastborn? Do they know they did it? Did they learn to do it from observing the hangmen or did they always know how? If they always knew how, why did they make the hangmen?
- Can't be a mistake - that's the hook for the hangmen.
- Maybe they exist because souls are the bastion of mortals and they want to weaken it. If they aren't allies, they won't feel like kin. Maybe these lastborn were created to see the flaws in mortal souls clearly so that they would inevitably side with the whistlers.
- What if they contain the sparks of a dead whistler? Manifestations of First Breath, maybe? Escaped positive aspects of the whistlers themselves that they want to destroy, freeing themselves from morality, altogether.
- What even is a soul? Like a subdivision of sentience, maybe? Like whistlers can't be subdivided, but mortals can (souls and bodies).
- Like shedding or molting?





NOTE: Their article on Venezualan Hairy Dwarves is fairly robust: https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Venezuelan_Hairy_Dwarves
