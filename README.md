### Story Brainstorm

Maybe something to do with Gallows?

Some new lastborn kinship is created. who should it be?
- What about the Varginha Devil of Brazil? It is also a South American myth, so there's some connection with the Silbon (kind of).
- https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Varginha_Devil
- The three ridged head and red eyes might be a good direction to go.

An Adalonean hangman discovers these new lastborn. Perhaps they initially clash, but soon grow respect for one another. (This will depend a great deal on what the whistlers might have made them for.)

So maybe give them unique units so that the two groups can battle one another for multiple missions.

Lastborn Kinship:Thunn’ha?

Name:

-Thunn’ha (Lovecraftian Frog People) thuum'ha
-Loveland Frog?
-https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Thuum%27ha?file=Thuumha.jpg


Abilities:

- Magic wands
- Maybe the ability to channel electricity through wood? Thus,the wands and sprays of sparks.
- Maybe they speak or see through wood?
- Maybe their mouths are enormous and only for eating, but the sparks make sounds like talking.
- Maybe their hands and feet come from snail shells and they have eyestalks in their hands that look like wands.
- I think their tongues should also be a semi-autonomous part of their anatomy, perhaps with eyes of its own.
- The frog appearance could BE the shell.

Purpose:

- To befriend the hangmen? Like this is the plan somehow?
- To carry disease.
- Something to do with the towns/forts they defend.
