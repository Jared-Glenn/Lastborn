### Story Brainstorm

Maybe something to do with Gallows?

Some new lastborn kinship is created. who should it be?
- What about the Varginha Devil of Brazil? It is also a South American myth, so there's some connection with the Silbon (kind of).
- https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Varginha_Devil
- The three ridged head and red eyes might be a good direction to go.

An Adalonean hangman discovers these new lastborn. Perhaps they initially clash, but soon grow respect for one another. (This will depend a great deal on what the whistlers might have made them for.)

So maybe give them unique units so that the two groups can battle one another for multiple missions.

Maybe a reason to try to move west?

Maybe creating a home in Croatova?

That would mean making fortifications, rather than conquering, which is fun too.



Lastborn Kinship:Thunn’ha?

Name:

-Thunn’ha (Lovecraftian Frog People) thuum'ha
-Loveland Frog?
-https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Thuum%27ha?file=Thuumha.jpg


Abilities:

- Magic wands
- Maybe the ability to channel electricity through wood? Thus,the wands and sprays of sparks.
- Maybe they speak or see through wood?
- Maybe their mouths are enormous and only for eating, but the sparks make sounds like talking.
- Maybe their hands and feet come from snail shells and they have eyestalks in their hands that look like wands.
- I think their tongues should also be a semi-autonomous part of their anatomy, perhaps with eyes of its own.
- The frog appearance could BE the shell.
- Duskmotts build rails for chainrail gunners that can move quickly, but only on the rail. The rail can be destroyed, but the gunner is pretty tough.

Purpose:

- To befriend the hangmen? Like this is the plan somehow?
- To carry disease.
- Something to do with the towns/forts they defend.
- These guys have mortal souls, and mortal souls bring life and change from the Manifest for the Host Kings and carry back dust and certainty from Destron for the Whistlers.
- Maybe they carry something else? Memory and experience? Naivete and wonder? Some unique aspect of life?
- Why create a new mortal soul for lastborn? Do they know they did it? Did they learn to do it from observing the hangmen or did they always know how? If they always knew how, why did they make the hangmen?
- Can't be a mistake - that's the hook for the hangmen.
- Maybe they exist because souls are the bastion of mortals and they want to weaken it. If they aren't allies, they won't feel like kin. Maybe these lastborn were created to see the flaws in mortal souls clearly so that they would inevitably side with the whistlers.
- What if they contain the sparks of a dead whistler? Manifestations of First Breath, maybe? Escaped positive aspects of the whistlers themselves that they want to destroy, freeing themselves from morality, altogether.
- What even is a soul? Like a subdivision of sentience, maybe? Like whistlers can't be subdivided, but mortals can (souls and bodies).
- Like shedding or molting?
- If these lastborn are kin, wouldn't that make Maria, Tess, and Jo kin too? Could be an issue.
- Fragments of First Breath might be possible. Maybe they're like manifestations of his creative spirit.
- Consider Asteib Ni. If he disappeared after making the hangmen, why continue with this? Seems like there should be a good twist here or else Asteib Ni begins to look like a fool.
- Asteib Ni seems like he should be revealed to be a mastermind.
- **I think the frog-snails should be revealed villains.**
- Asteib Ni decided that souls could be a helper, but intends to win by CONVINCING the frong-snails to side with the Lastborn and whistlers.
- The frog-snails are agents of Asteib Ni at the beginning.
- It could be a major turning point for the idea of kin.

### Three Factions or Five?
No air, but maybe tech and magic?
Use other kinships or all lastborn? It might be hard if none of the factions are just cowboys, essentially.

- Memory and Rebirth
- Strong melee starter (Ten-blades)
- Sixer shooter
- Moving Buildings

#### Pluckers

- Large and bloodthirsty
- Death feeds them

#### Frog-Snails?

- Ranged starters
- Fang blades?
- Slow but strong?

#### Duskmotts
- Standard Cowboy
- Skip watches
- Jump up and down cliffs.

#### Mugwumps

NOTE: Their article on Venezualan Hairy Dwarves is fairly robust: https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Venezuelan_Hairy_Dwarves

## Plot:

-The hangmen are exploring old Adalon under the leadership of Connor Elmen (? might be another name).
- Maybe Connor is a hangman that is part of the Loyal Brethren and believes in diplomacy and the essential goodness of all kin.
- A few missions helping duskmotts from Plucker attacks.
- The Frog-snails appear and their leader offers to help.
- The snail-frogs are also in trouble from the pluckers.
- Pluckers are growing their numbers and pushing south toward New Dometius.
- Something with Eighth of the West. Maybe he threatens to strengthen the curse of Croatova to wipe out all kin. Then it can focus on a conflict trying to avoid that. This could also create issues with hokflatzuls or the Host Kings, leading to the duskmott campaign.
- A duskmott campaign could be either working FOR the host kings or fighting AGAINST them. (Kind if a UED SC storyline.)
